# Grun.Net

A set of tools written in C# for testing ANTLR generated C# grammar assemblies. 
These tools are meant to supplement the need to continually build java classes to test with the java TestRig assembly.

As of this moment the --Tokens option is the only one supported.  Support for additional options will follow shortly.
